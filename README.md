# TV Program App

dated May 2024 and was improved in September 2025. the idea was to create a desktop application for managing a weekly TV program schedule. users can switch between days of the week, add, edit, or delete programs, and view them in a table sorted by time. the app also supports searching by time or name, and automatically saves all changes to a `schedule.json` file.
